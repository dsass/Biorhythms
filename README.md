# Biorhythms

Despite our best efforts, we do not experience time as the clock ticks. Our experience of time is inconsistent at best, changing with our bodies and our surroundings. This clock, and the piece around it, instead tick along to your biorhythms.

Biorhythms is an interactive installation piece displayed at the Gray Area 2019.1 Showcase.
